### Auction Platform

This a repository for an auction platform working on the ETH Blockchain, developed using solidity.

### Implementation:

Build an auction platform in which:
    
- [ ] Users can start a new auction;

- [ ] Users can bid on an auction;

- [ ] The highest bidder should recieve the prize after the auction ends.

- [ ] Each user can see what the highest bid is on any auction;

- [ ] Once a new highest bid is placed, the previous highest bidded should recieve a notification of the event. His bid should also be returned;

- [x] Auctions must have a time limit up to which bidding is possible;

- [x] With every new bid the time limit on an auction should increase, if it was below a certain time;

- [x] Users that start an auction must not be able to place bid on that auction.
